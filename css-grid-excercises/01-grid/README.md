# The Holy Grail Layout with Grid

We'll only be using Grid. You'll be able to see the benefits of Grid for yourself!

### Hints

- You only need to add to the CSS selectors
- Look back to the Creating a Grid lesson if you forget how to turn an element into a grid
- Use fixed track sizes (e.g. pixels) for your columns and rows

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check

- The gap is 15px
- The grid has two columns
- The grid has four rows
- The second column is three times larger than the first
- The third row is five times larger than the others
- The header and footer elements span across both columns
- The sidebar element only spans across the first column
- The nav and article elements span across the second column
